# Dance Dance Revolution

The main inspiration of our project was the well-known game *Dance Dance Revolution*, 
which has a pad with 9 squares, out of which 4 are used for the actual game. Those used are 
highlighted by 4 arrows (up, down, right, left) which are meant to be pressed when the game displays 
the corresponding arrow.

Under each arrow square there is a pressure sensor, which will help us to detect if the user 
steps on that square. Unless, a buzzer will release an error sound such that to inform the player that 
he/she misstepped. The 4 sensors and the buzzer are connected to the *Arduino Uno* board.
